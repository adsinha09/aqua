# Aqua GitHub Pages

This project is designed to create a GitHub Pages website for the Aqua project, which focuses on automating experimental optics using sample-efficient machine learning methods. The website will serve as a platform to share research findings, visualizations, and code related to the project.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.md**: This file contains the main content for the GitHub Pages site, formatted in Markdown. It will be rendered as the homepage of the site.
- **assets/style.css**: This file contains custom CSS styles for the GitHub Pages site. It is used to apply a dark theme to the site.
- **README.md**: This file provides documentation for the project, explaining its purpose and how to set it up.
- **_config.yml**: This file is the configuration file for GitHub Pages. It specifies settings such as the theme, layout, and other options for the site.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arindam5aha/aqua.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```

   ```

3. **Customize the Content**: Edit the `index.md` file to include your desired content for the homepage. You can use Markdown syntax to format the text, add images, and create links.

4. **Style the Site**: Modify the `assets/style.css` file to customize the appearance of your site. The current styles are set to provide a dark theme.

5. **Configure the Site**: Update the `_config.yml` file to set your site title, description, and any other configuration options you need.
